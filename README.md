## Analyzing-Interview-Transcripts
### Or: How to deal with big amounts of qualitative data?
---
**Project Description**
- I have the transcripts of several 90min interviews with students
- Not all the parts of the interview are relevant
- I want to identify the parts when students explain the given phenomena
- These explanations should be categorized into what we call "narrative mode" or "scientific mode"
- There a certain language features that indicate which "mode" the student is in
- In the end it would be valuable to know how long they are in each mode and how many switches occur

 *Data Source*
 
 The transcripts were generated by an AI tool (from the originally recorded audio files)
 
 Right now they appear in an excel file, maybe I have to transfer everything to a text file
