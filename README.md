## Analyzing-Interview-Transcripts
### Or: How to deal with big amounts of qualitative data?
---
**Project Description**
- I have the transcripts of several 90min interviews with students
- Not all the parts of the interview are relevant
- I want to identify the parts when students explain the given phenomena
- These explanations should be categorized into what we call "narrative mode" or "scientific mode"
- There a certain language features that indicate which "mode" the student is in
- In the end it would be valuable to know how long they are in each mode and how many switches occur

*Theoretical Background*

The narrative mode is active when individuals interpret events around them using a story-like pattern, in which characters and their actions shape the unfolding plot. It is characterized by agents that act in accordance with their intentions or motivation. If applied in a scientific context, misconception may arise. A common example among students is to say: "The plant needs  more light, so it grows towards the light". In this case the "need" of the plant (reflecting intention or motivation) is seen as the cause of the plant to grow towards the light, which is not scientific. 
The

 *Data Source*
 1. The transcripts were generated by an AI tool (from the originally recorded audio files)
 3. The data are confidential (because the interviews are with minors) so I cannot upload them in a public space

 
:memo: **Technical Aspects**
- Right now transcrips appear in an excel file, maybe I have to transfer everything to a text file
